This notebook provides an introduction to data munging in the tidyverse. Why
tidyverse you might ask? Personally, I find it a really nice way to learn the 
'grammar of graphics' and 'grammar of data' - probably the best intro in my 
opinion, which is why I love teaching it.

The agenda for this 1 hour bootcamp includes:

1. Loading data w/ readr
2. Dates and times w/ lubridate
3. Tidy data concepts w/ tidyr
4. Feature engineering w/ dplyr
5. Visualization w/ ggplot2

We will need the following libraries for this bootcamp

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Loading data w/ readr

The first thing we need to do with data is consistently load it. R has some 
basic functionality with `read.csv`, and data.table is the best for large
datasets, using `fread`, but here we are going to demo a load an inspect for
the demo data.

https://readr.tidyverse.org/
Check out the cheat shhet here, paying attention to the 'write' functions

My general formula for loading data:
1) Load it (does it fail?)
2) Run head()
3) Look at the dimensions
4) Check the column data types

```{r}
treatments = readr::read_csv("./data/PerfTreatment_subset.csv")

#old school
head(treatments)
dim(treatments)
str(treatments)
summary(treatments)

#lazy school
colnames(treatments)
treatments
```

```{r}
well_header = readr::read_csv("./data/WellHeader_subset.csv")
well_header
colnames(well_header)
str(well_header)
```

```{r}
production = readr::read_csv("./data/WellProduction_subset.csv")
production
colnames(production)
str(production)
```

## Dates and times w/ lubridate

https://lubridate.tidyverse.org/

Working with dates is hard and constantly a struggle, especially when working
with excel. I would really encourage everyone to look at and follow the
ISO8601 format.

```{r}
production$date = date(production$ProdPeriod)
unique(production$date)

# make a sequence
date_seq = seq(min(production$date), max(production$date), by = "month")

# compare this
single_well <- production %>%
  filter(EPAssetsId == 2225574) %>%
  spread(key=ProdType, value=Volume)

# with this
single_well <- production %>%
  filter(EPAssetsId == 2225574) %>%
  select(date, ProdType, Volume) %>%
  spread(key=ProdType, value=Volume)
```

## Tidy data concepts w/ tidyr

There is a well defined concept of 'tidy data' which is well summarized in this paper:

https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf

To quote the paper, in tidy data:
1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The concept of 'wide' and 'long' tables is really important in data science,
and worth chatting about. In our dataset, `production` is a long table and
`well_header` and `treatments` are wide tables. 

Long tables are pretty nice when doing summaries and graphs, but can be difficult
to use in machine learning models or summarize properly. For example, if you
wanted to facet a ggplot among several groups, you will need a long table.

```{r}
# why long plots are useful
ggplot(production) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x=Volume)) +
  facet_wrap(. ~ ProdType, scales='free')
```

But we can pivot tables back and forth relatively easily in R using the tidyr package. Read more and check out the cheat sheet here:

https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/

```{r}
# long to wide
prod_wide = spread(
  production, 
  key=ProdType, 
  value=Volume
  )

# wide to long
treat_long = gather(
  treatments, 
  'IntervalTop','IntervalBase', 
  key="interval",
  value="md")
```

There are two packages I use for dealing with missing values. Most machine learning models and correlation analyses need complete, clean datasets, so 
missing values tend to be a bane of our data science existence. I will cover 
a column imputer framework next session, but tidyr has some great functions 
for dealing with NA (not applicable) values: `drop_na`, `fill`, and `replace_na`.

```{r}
single_well

single_well %>% drop_na()

single_well %>% tidyr::fill(.direction="up")

single_well %>% 
```


## Feature engineering w/ dplyr

Dplyr provides a consistent interface for data munging.

https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/

```{r}

```

## Visualization w/ ggplot2

ggplot2 (grammar of graphics plotting) is in my opinion the best user interface
for static plots. There are so many visualization tools that no single tool
will be the best, but ggplot2 often beats any other tool I use.

https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/

```{r}

```
